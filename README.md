## Description 
This is a simple readme generator application. It provides a standard structure for the markdown file and associated formatting. As a new developer and a current student, putting together a readme file is still new and challenging. This application provides prompts to guide the user through relevant content that should be included in a proper readme. 
A benefit to using this application is that it saves time for the user by building the readme and applying the relevant formatting for the user. This also allows for a standardized approach to the content.

## Lessons Learned
In building this application I was able to learn a lot more about working with javascript and it's interface with node. Some specific topics that were newly intrtoduced when building this application are template literals, arrow functions, writing and appending files, retrieving information from the terminal, let and const variable scope, node modules (specifically inquirer and axios), etc. Although there was a large amount of new knowledge gained, it became very clear that I've just scratched the surface. 
## Installation
To use this application, please ensure that node.js and npm are installed and ready to use on your machine. Clone this repository to your local machine. Navigate to the working directory in the terminal, then run "npm i" in the terminal to install inquirer. Once that is complete, run the application with "node index.js" in the terminal and start filling in your content. 
## Usage
To run this application, enter "node index.js" in the terminal and begin to answer the prompts. Any section that is not needed will be excluded from the table of contents and the readme file. To ensure that unwanted sections are not included, leave the associated questions blank. For example, is there are no contributors to list, skip that prompt by leaving the response blank and hitting enter. The readme file is created with a file name based on the user input for project name. To avoid overriding a prior file, make sure to use a different project name.
