## Description 
This application is a CMS style blog site where users can publish posts or comment existing posts from other users. It utilizes the MVC method through Sequelize, Handlebars, Express, and Express-Session. 
This application provides an easy to use and simple platform for sharing stories, discoveries and general information about tech.

## Lessons Learned
Building this application proved to be very challenging. It involved furthering my knowledge of associations and relations in sequelize, developing various api routes, using CRUD to pass user inputs front the browser to the MySQL database, and finally accessing data from the database to display via rendered handlbar templates. A surprise I encountered was the refresher on fron-end javascript and how that interfaced with the controller routes in the MVC framework. 
## Usage
This application is currently deployed on Heroku, so just follow the link and have fun!
